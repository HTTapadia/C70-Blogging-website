  <p class="text-muted text-left" >Quaint little restaurant tucked inside a by-lane of Juhu.  Blink and you will miss the entrance to the cafe.  So be alert enough to spot the black signboard that says "Prithvi cafe" while you are on the main road. The restaurant has a reasonably good menu at reasonable prices.  The food is delicious, the servings are quite large and some dishes can be shared by 2 people. Attracts quite a trendy crowd of aspiring celebrities on show days.  Be sure  to book in advance to avoid disappointments.  On other days, the crowd there is pretty hep & happening. Hosts the famous "Prithvi theater fest", which you must attend if possible. </p>

  <h5 class="text-success text-left text-capitalize" >i had visited in 2018</h5>

  <p class="text-muted text-left" >The Mysore Palace, officially known as Mysuru Palace, is a historical palace and the royal residence at Mysore in the Indian state of Karnataka. It is the official residence of the Wadiyar dynasty and the seat of the Kingdom of Mysore. The palace is in the centre of Mysore, and faces the Chamundi Hills eastward. Mysore is commonly described as the 'City of Palaces', and there are seven palaces including this one; however, 'Mysore Palace' refers specifically to this one within the Old fort.

The land on which the palace now stands was originally known as mysuru, and is now known as the new Fort. Yaduraya built the first palace inside the Old Fort in the 14th century, which was burnt ablaze and constructed multiple times. The old fort was constructed using wood and thus was the reason for the old fort to catch on fire, the current fort was made up of stone,bricks and wood.The current structure was constructed between 1897 and 1912, after the Old Palace was burnt ablaze.

Mysore Palace is now one of the most famous tourist attractions in India, after the Taj Mahal, with more than 6 million annual visitors. </p>

  <h5 class="text-success text-left text-capitalize" >i had visited in 2016</h5>

  <p class="text-muted text-left" >The Taj Mahal 'Crown of the Palace', is an ivory-white marble mausoleum on the right bank of the river Yamuna in the Indian city of Agra. It was commissioned in 1632 by the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan (reigned from 1628 to 1658) to house the tomb of his favourite wife, Mumtaz Mahal; it also houses the tomb of Shah Jahan himself. The tomb is the centrepiece of a 17-hectare (42-acre) complex, which includes a mosque and a guest house, and is set in formal gardens bounded on three sides by a crenellated wall.

Construction of the mausoleum was essentially completed in 1643, but work continued on other phases of the project for another 10 years. The Taj Mahal complex is believed to have been completed in its entirety in 1653 at a cost estimated at the time to be around 32 million rupees, which in 2020 would be approximately 70 billion rupees (about U.S. $956 million). The construction project employed some 20,000 artisans under the guidance of a board of architects led by the court architect to the emperor, Ustad Ahmad Lahauri. </p>

 <p>Saw it today with my kids and they loved it. You should have a minimal previous understanding of the movies or you’ll miss 40% of the fun. At minimum:Infinity War, Civil War, Black Panther, Age of Ultron, Ant Man and the Wasp. Problem is that the whole movie is homage to all movies. Yet you will enjoy it a lot.There is at the beginning of the movie a (spoiler alert) head dismemberment that is quite impressive. But most is comic book style figand battles. It does last 3 hours all worthwhile.</p>

 <p> This movie is spot-on! The way the movie was designed, it brings in chills and excitement at the same time. First, the alien "mother" ship enters Earth's orbit, the scene cuts to an S.E.T.I. station in New Mexico, technicians discovered that the space craft approximately one fourth the size of the moon has been in position. Later, in Washington, D.C., at the Pentagon, the general was brought into the tech room and looked at the radar on the plexiglass table. The president is then awakened at the White House, and intercepted a heads-up by the Secretary of Defense. Second, the satellite hits the mother ship, causing a division of city destroyers in different areas. As the computer expert intercepts the signal, he compares it to playing chess to his boss at a Cable Office. Then, aliens arrive in major cities that include Paris, Moscow, London, Berlin, Sydney, New York City, Los Angeles, and Washington. As time flies fast, an evacuation call was made by the president, telling all citizens to leave all cities, as the aliens are about to deploy their weapons at all main landmarks, including the U.S. Bank Tower, The Empire State Building, and The White House, which the president and others evacuated in the nick of time. The LAPD was persuading the people, who were celebrating on rooftops of each building, to evacuate for their own safety, but people never listened. Instead, the primary weapon shot the energy beam on the buildings, causing a fire-rolling hurricane. The survivors were fighting off the aliens to pay back for what they did. Not all missiles could get through, but one man, who became the hero, risked his life to save the planet.</p>

 <p> Absolutely astounding and incredible. If I had to choose a favorite from just the first 3 Star Wars films it would definitely be this one, with its great mystery, musical score, characters, intense battles, astounding effects, wonderful locations and all else this film has to offer this masterpiece is yet another Star Wars work of art. Samuel L. Jackson, Frank Oz and Christopher Lee still do a very commendable and incredible job at their roles as Master Windu, Master Yoda and Count Dooku, all other actors were just as amazing that I can't even find the words. This film is so intriguing because it's exactly how we see one of the most iconic Disney villains ever come to be and if you ask me seeing how Darth Vader came to be is both very intriguing and pretty heartbreaking at the same time, but it's also still very intriguing as we see how Luke Skywalker and Princess Leia came to be as well. Watch this movie and see for yourself who the real culprit behind the war and the real Sith Lord really is, how Darth Vader came to be and what became of Luke and Leia after their birth, if you like it than excellent and keep on going because the excitement and surprises don't stop there, but if you don't like it than no worries because you can't please everyone. 5/5 For Sure!!!!!</p>

 <p>   I really love the message about bringing others together thought music and performing arts, keep perspective and be yourself!  Additionally, I am so intrigued, energetic, enthusiastic, and inspired by Zac Efron's performance as Phillip Carlyle as he truly embodied the transformative character.  Phillip is talented, skilled, sweet, hot, and truly develops a complete personality for music of singing and dancing.  Phillip is also more intelligent than P.T. and Phillip creates a good mentor and a great friend to him.  Phillip is also thoughtful, generous helpful, and compassionate and shows a very nice soft heart for Anne.  And I am also pretty energetic and enthusiastic with Hugh Jackman's performance as P.T. Barnum as he truly embodied the transformative character by his mentors Phillip and Charity.  P.T. is a man of big dreams and also has a big personality of music of singing and dancing and having so much fame so that he can never be rejected by anyone but he also provides a good mentor for Phillip and a loyal companion.  I really loved that in this movie which is a musical which it truly is, Michael Gracey and the rest of the production companies what I really loved about this movie is that all of the cast members who were in this movie who singed and danced to all the songs sounded and acted like just spectacular angels who are all alive!!!  They really really really do!!!  So I really really really hope that all the cast members that performed in all the songs continue to sing and dance in the future musical movies because this is what these cast members are awesome at and I know that really like doing musical movies and I am pretty sure that musical movies play everything that they love because the cast that performed songs in movies love the sing and dance and as far as I know they are awesome at it!!!  The songs themselves always makes enthusiastic and energetic ever time I watch this movie because of the cast members who performed in these songs and danced!!!  These cast members are awesome and it literally plays everything that love about acting!!!!  When looking at the music score my most favorite song was the one found in the middle of the movie called,   This movie is full of music, fame, empathy, faith, talent, love, and family.  Thank you so much production companies for the outstanding movie!  In my strong opinion this is one of the most successful movies you guys have ever created!!!  Please keep making more musical films that focus on heartfelt messages which bring people together by accepting differences and hearing stories that go unnoticed.</p>
